## Description
🔍 This project is my Team profile generator. With this application, I am able to create team profiles for my team at work by only utilizing answers from the command line. After I am prompted for whether or not I want to add additional team members, once I complete my team and respond "no", my team is generated to my team's webpage where it can be viewed by the public!
